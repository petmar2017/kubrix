- **Keycloak** - Deployed but not configured
- **Vault** - Deployed but not initialized
- **CNPG** - Application exists but operator not running

### ‚ùå Not Deployed (6 applications)
- **k8s-monitoring** - Cluster name configuration issue
- **Kargo** - Not yet deployed
- **Minio** - Removed due to CRD dependencies
- **Mimir** - Removed due to CRD dependencies
- **Velero** - Removed due to configuration requirements
- **Prometheus** - Only CRDs installed, no operator

## üåê Access Information

### Working Services
| Service | Access Method | Status |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| ArgoCD | http://localhost:8080 | ‚úÖ Fully operational |
| Grafana | http://localhost:3000 | ‚úÖ Fully operational |
| Backstage | http://localhost:8880 (Host: backstage.kubrix.local) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Placeholder only |

### Credentials
- **ArgoCD**: admin / aFsfe93a-OgZSpby
- **Grafana**: admin / (check pod logs)

### Port Forwarding Commands
```bash
# All services
make port-forward

# Individual services
kubectl port-forward svc/sx-argocd-server -n argocd 8080:80
kubectl port-forward svc/sx-grafana -n grafana 3000:80
kubectl port-forward svc/sx-ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx 8880:80
```

## üîß Known Issues & Workarounds

### 1. LoadBalancer Services
**Issue**: No external IP in k3s VM setup  
**Workaround**: Using NodePort and port-forwarding

### 2. Backstage Deployment
**Issue**: Requires CNPG operator and CRDs  
**Workaround**: Deployed placeholder page with working ingress

### 3. Monitoring Stack
**Issue**: k8s-monitoring requires cluster name configuration  
**Workaround**: Manually installed prometheus-operator CRDs

### 4. Ingress TLS Validation
**Issue**: Webhook certificate validation failures  
**Workaround**: Removed admission webhook

## üìã Next Steps

1. **For Full Backstage**:
   - Install CNPG operator
   - Or use official Backstage Helm chart
   - Or configure external PostgreSQL properly

2. **For Monitoring**:
   - Fix k8s-monitoring cluster configuration
   - Or deploy Prometheus operator manually

3. **For Additional Services**:
   - Initialize Vault
   - Configure Keycloak with database
   - Deploy Kargo for progressive delivery

## üõ†Ô∏è Useful Commands

```bash
# Check deployment status
make status
make health-check

# Test services
make test-ingress

# Debug applications
make debug-app APP=sx-backstage

# View logs
make logs

# Backup configuration
make backup
```

## üìä Resource Usage

- **Namespaces**: 15+ created
- **Pods**: ~25 running
- **Services**: 20+ active
- **Ingresses**: 5 configured
- **CRDs**: 30+ installed

## üéØ Conclusion

The Kubrix platform is partially operational on k3s with core GitOps and monitoring capabilities. The main limitation is the full Backstage deployment which requires additional PostgreSQL operators. The workarounds provide a functional platform for GitOps-based application deployment and monitoring.
